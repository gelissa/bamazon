# Bamazon
Bamazon is a Node.js app which searches through a list of items housed in the Bamazon warehouse. 

You, the user, are a guest who is trying to buy products wholesale from the warehouse. When you specify the item you would like to buy, the app shows you the item and asks how many you would like to buy. 

The app then increments the amount of items you would like from the amount there are in the warehouse. From there, you can enjoy your Bamazon purchase. 

# Tools
For this app, I use Node.js, inquiry npm package, mysql npm package, mySQL databases. The project is deployed on GitHub.
